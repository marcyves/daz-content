Little DAZ Content Manager for Mac OS

This morning I stumbled upon a little [DAZ Content Manager for Windows](https://www.renderosity.com/freestuff/items/97996/my3dcontent) made by [KeithTX](https://www.renderosity.com/users/KeithTX) and available for free at [Renderosity](https://www.renderosity.com/).

That looked awesome but I wanted to make a version that I could use on my Mac. So I decided to make my own version. I wanted to make it as simple as possible, so I decided to use Python and Tkinter. 

## Features
